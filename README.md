## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where a mundane, traditionally 'feminine' ritual (like applying makeup, cooking a meal, choosing an outfit) becomes a site of profound spiritual encounter.
- Create a dialogue between the protagonist and her younger self at the moment of the avocado tub epiphany. What wisdom does the younger version hold that the older one has forgotten?
- Imagine the protagonist encountering a spiritual teacher or guide who is not a traditional guru, but perhaps an elderly woman, a queer artist, or a non-human entity. Describe their first lesson.
- Write a 'confessional' chapter from the perspective of another character in the book (Sam, the mother, Jason) exploring their own parallel, unseen spiritual seeking.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build an interactive 'Ritual Map' that visualizes the protagonist's journey, plotting key spiritual moments (like the bathroom, the basement) against feminist theory concepts she encounters, showing the tension and synthesis.
- Create a text generator that produces 'Mundane Epiphanies'—short, poetic prose pieces where a simple, everyday object or action is described in a way that reveals its hidden spiritual dimension.

## Origin

Generated through persona500's Council-Prism Generation.
SASI evaluation: 8/10

Council: Maggie Nelson (for autotheory & blending personal confession with intellectual rigor), Annie Dillard (for finding the transcendent in precise, physical detail), Audre Lorde (for the power of the erotic as spiritual and the insistence that personal feeling is political data), Teresa of Ávila (for mapping the interior castle of a woman's spiritual experience outside institutional sanction)
